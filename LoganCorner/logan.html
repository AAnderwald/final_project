                            He gives me a hug and walks to the bedroom door, turns his head to look at me and starts snapping his fingers. 
                            
                            Which makes no noise since he hasn't figured out how to snap yet.

                            Shaking his little butt he says: Put your dance shoes on mama, put your dance shoes on. 
                            
                            And he starts to shuffle his feet like he's dancing.

                            My husband has a game on his iPad called Hay Day, Logan loves to take over the game. 
                            
                            I decided to download the game on my kindle. 
                            
                            I have hidden the game on my kindle from my dear son for the past three months. 
                            
                            Every time I'm on my kindle he tries to see what I am doing; I am not always on the game but sometimes I am. 
                            
                            Now, night times are the worse because dear sweet Logan likes to come out of his room to avoid sleeping. 
                            
                            Happens every night, tonight the little snot sneaks up on me playing my game on the kindle. 
                            
                            Logans dad: Logan go to bed 
                            
                            Me putting kindle face down in my lap.
                            
                            Logan slowly smiles at me and says: You’ve been discovered.
                            
                            Me thinking: Crap there goes my game.

                            Logan has a new phrase this week: You don’t see that every day. 

                            It starts when we saw a commercial on some new toy. 

                            Logan tilts his little head and says: “You don’t see that every day.” 
                            
                            We are at Aunties house. Yes it’s Aunties not Aunt Christine. 

                            He sees her beautiful roses outside with bees flying around them: “Well, you don’t see that every day.” 
                            
                            We are walking to our car and some random dog had pooped near our car: “You don’t see that every day.” 
                            
                            We are at the restaurant and Logan looks at the kid's menu at some random picture on the menu: “Well, you don’t see that every day.” 
                            
                            He’s watching the LEGO movie and the bad guy had done something but I don’t recall what. “You don’t see that every day.”

                            Logan is reading a story in school. They have these books with dogs, mainly there are two dogs. 

                            He was reading one that happened to be about two dogs that dressed up as cowboys. 
                            
                            He reads the page to himself first, then the teacher calls on someone to read it out loud.

                            As he is reading to himself this is how it went: 

                            Logan: “Look” said Jack “I am a cowboy” 

                            A quick pause 

                            Logan: You don't look like a cowboy you look like a fricken dog
